Image Perver

I'm working with TIFF scans of double-sided pages.  My normal tool,
xzgv, fails me here.  I despair at trying all the image viewers Debian
has, because I know that I'll find sixteen piles of suck that don't do
what I want, three fancies that are wrong, and exactly nothing that
works.

This is an image viewer designed for looking at scans of books.  It
displays both the verso (left) and recto (right) of each spread on the
screen at the same time.  The intent is to approach a book reading
experience, but also have useful doodads hanging off the side.  It's
not exactly intended to be just a ready thing.
